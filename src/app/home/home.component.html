<p>
  I have do two solutions for AST. First with the existing API, which was already there
  and second by adding same logic in Util and using it.
</p>

<p>First Solution has no dependencies.</p>

<p>
  For second Solution you have to clone <a href='https://github.com/abhishek-kaushik/abstract-syntax-tree' target="_blank">https://github.com/abhishek-kaushik/abstract-syntax-tree</a>
  and run it.
  using Data service to get the solution here.
